# Analysis-of-Online-Shopping-Factors
In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, convenience and efficiency have become central to daily life, driving the rise of online shopping as a preferred purchasing method. The recent pandemic has further accelerated this trend by significantly reducing the feasibility of in-store shopping. In response to these developments, we have chosen to focus our research on "Factors Influencing Online Shopping."

Given the relevance of this topic to everyday life, our team designed and distributed an online survey to collect statistical data. We successfully gathered 135 valid responses, which will form the basis of our analysis using R language for a detailed examination of the factors driving online shopping behavior.
